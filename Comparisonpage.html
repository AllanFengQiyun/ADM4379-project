                When it comes to gaming there really isn't a wrong answer, there are plenty of differences that suits
                different people in thier own way, however, the reason that we believe Playstation is superior is
                because of the price and the overall advantage it has when comparing other platforms' graphics and
                loading times.

                           For Playstation 5 there aren't many disadvantages, it is one of the best gaming consoles of our time,
                            however nothing is perfect and there are some disadvantages, such as, the digital version of the Playstation 5 does not have a disc reader, 
                            and while some people see this as a disadvantage it could be seen as an advantage since it lowers the price and does not lose any of the graphics or processing power.

                            Although the Xbox Series X is a strong gaming system, it does have several drawbacks.
                            First of all, compared to other gaming consoles on the market, its expensive price may be a deterrent for certain customers.
                            Another problem is that certain Xbox games only have limited backwards compatibility, 
                            which can be disheartening for players who have a lot of older games.             </li>

                                There are a number of drawbacks to the PlayStation 4 Pro. 
                                One of the biggest problems is that not all games support actual 4K resolution; instead, many games use upscaled versions of lesser resolutions. 
                                As a result, some video games might not appear as detailed or crisp as they would on a 4K TV. 
                                The PS4 Pro's hardware is also less powerful than the newest gaming PCs, so it could have trouble running the most demanding games at their highest settings. In addition, the PS4 Pro lacks built-in VR functionality, thus anyone interested in VR experiences will need to buy extra hardware.
                                Last but not least, the PS4 Pro has a only 1TB of internal storage, which might not be enough for people with a larger collection of games.

                            Gaming on a PC has several disadvanatges compared to gaming on a console. Building or
                            updating a gaming PC can be expensive and time-consuming, especially for players who desire a high-end
                            system, which is one of the primary problems. Compatibility problems may also have an impact on PC gaming due to the inability for hardware to match up on a systems motherboard,
                            with certain games not performing properly on specific hardware setups or requiring frequent
                            updates to fix bugs or performance difficulties. Furthermore, it might be difficult for gamers to
                            getappropriate components or to solve problems when they develop due to the huge variety of
                            hardwareoptions and configurations. PC gaming might be more difficult for players who lack a high
                            degree of technical expertise since it demands such a high level of technical understanding.
